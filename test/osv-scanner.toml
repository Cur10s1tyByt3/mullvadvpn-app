There is no reported vulnerability in the `instant` crate, but it is unmaintained and the author suggest switching to
a fork instead of depending on `instant`. In our tree it is `ssh2` that currently depend on `instant` through an old
version of `parking_lot`, preventing us from upgrading to a fixed version. This ignore can be removed when
https://github.com/alexcrichton/ssh2-rs/issues/338 is resolved.

There is a privelege escalation in the `idna` crate, which affects consumers that accept arbitrary domain names
as input, which we do not. A fix has been released in version `1.0.0`, and currently our dependencies `hickory-proto`
and `shadowsocks` prevent us from upgrading to a safe version of `idna`. New releases of these depencies which are not
vulnerable to RUSTSEC-2024-0421 is tracked in the following GitHub issues:
