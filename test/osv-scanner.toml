There is no reported vulnerability in the `instant` crate, but it is unmaintained and the author suggest switching to
a fork instead of depending on `instant`. In our tree it is `ssh2` that currently depend on `instant` through an old
version of `parking_lot`, preventing us from upgrading to a fixed version. This ignore can be removed when
https://github.com/alexcrichton/ssh2-rs/issues/338 is resolved.
